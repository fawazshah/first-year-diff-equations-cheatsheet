\paragraph{Homogenous (difference equation)}

\paragraph{Forward difference operator $ \Delta $}
The forward difference operator is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta U(n) = U(n+1) - U(n)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Newton-Raphson method}
The Newton-Raphson iterative formula to find $ x $ such that $ f(x) = 0 $ is:
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}
\end{equation}
Note that this only works in specific cases.

\paragraph{Taylor series (multivariable)}
The Taylor series centered around $ (a, b) $ for a multivariable function $ f(x, y) $ can be written as:
\begin{align}
f(x, y) & = \color{cyan}{f(a, b)} + \color{blue}{f'_{x}(a, b)(x-a) + f'_{y}(a, b)(y-b)} \\
& + \color{magenta}{\frac{1}{2!}(f''_{xx}(a, b)(x-a)^{2} + 2f''_{xy}(a, b)(x-a)(y-b)} \\
& \ \ \ \color{magenta}{ + f''_{yy}(a, b)(y-b)^{2})} \color{black}{\textrm{ + ...}}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{equation}
f'_{x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad f''_{xx} = \frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}}, \quad f''_{xy} = \frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial y \partial x}\textrm{ ... etc.}
\end{equation}
If we let $ h = x - a $ and $ k = y - b $ then we can also write the Taylor series as:
\begin{align}
f(a+h, b+k) & = \color{cyan}{f(a, b)} + \color{blue}{hf'_{x}(a, b) + kf'_{y}(a, b)} \\
& + \color{magenta}{\frac{1}{2!}(h^{2}f''_{xx}(a, b) + 2hkf''_{xy}(a, b) + k^{2}f''_{yy}(a, b))} \color{black}{\textrm{ + ...}}
\end{align}

\paragraph{Exact (total) differential}
The exact differential of a multivariable function $ f(x, y) $ is the equation:
\begin{equation}
df = dx \frac{\partial f}{\partial  x} + dy \frac{\partial f}{\partial  y}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Exact equation}
A differential equation of the form:
\begin{equation} \label{exacteq}
P(x, y) + Q(x, y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
\end{equation}
is called an exact equation iff:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \equiv \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
Note that in this case the LHS of equation \ref{exacteq} forms an exact differential, which can be used to to find the general solution (explained later on).

\paragraph{Scalar field}
A function that associates a scalar value to every point in (3D) space.

\paragraph{Vector field}
A function that associates a vector to every point in (3D) space.

\paragraph{Partial differential operator $ \nabla $}
Imagine we have a 3D vector field with standard basis vectors $ \vec{i}, \vec{j} $ and $ \vec{k}  $. We define the operator $ \nabla $ to be:
\begin{equation}
\nabla = \vec{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \vec{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \vec{k} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{grad}
The gradient (grad) of a scalar field produces a vector field. For a scalar field $ \phi(x, y, z) $ we denote the grad as $ \nabla \phi $. At any point in space, grad is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \vec{i} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \vec{j} + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \vec{k}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{div}
The divergence (div) of a vector field produces a scalar field. For a vector field $ \vec{u}(x, y, z) $ we denote the div as $ \nabla \cdot \vec{u} $. At any point in space, div is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = \frac{\partial u_{1}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_{3}}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
where $ \begin{pmatrix}
u_{1} \\ u_{2} \\ u_{3}
\end{pmatrix} $ is the value of $ \vec{u} $ at that point.

\paragraph{curl}
The curl of a vector field produces a vector field. For a vector field $ \vec{u}(x, y, z) $ we denote the curl as $ \nabla \times \vec{u} $. At any point in space, curl is defined as:
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \vec{u} & = \det \begin{pmatrix}
\vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
u_{1} & u_{2} & u_{3}
\end{pmatrix} \\\\
& = (\frac{\partial u_{3}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial z})\vec{i} + (\frac{\partial u_{3}}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_{1}}{\partial z})\vec{j} + (\frac{\partial u_{2}}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_{1}}{\partial y})\vec{k}
\end{align}
where $ \begin{pmatrix}
u_{1} \\ u_{2} \\ u_{3}
\end{pmatrix} $ is the value of $ \vec{u} $ at that point.

\section{2nd order ODEs}

\subsection{Special case - y missing}
If we can write the $ 2^{nd} $ derivative in the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = f(x, \frac{dy}{dx})
\end{equation}
(i.e. no $ y $ terms present), then we can make a substitution. Let $ P = \frac{dy}{dx} $. This means $ \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = \frac{dP}{dx} $, the
refore we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dx} = f(x, P)
\end{equation}
This is 1st order w.r.t P and can be solved by appropriate 1st order methods.

\subsection{Special case - x missing}
If we can write the $ 2^{nd} $ derivative as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = f(y, \frac{dy}{dx})
\end{equation}
(i.e. no x terms present), then we can make the same substitution. Let $ P = \frac{dy}{dx} $. This means $ \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = \frac{dP}{dx} $, therefore we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dx} = f(y, P)
\end{equation}
However, this is not yet a 1st order equation since the derivative is w.r.t. x, but we only have y terms on the RHS.
\\\\
DIFFERENT TO LAST TIME: we must rewrite $ \frac{dP}{dx} $ as a derivative with respect to y. Luckily, we can see that:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dx} = \frac{dP}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx} = P\frac{dP}{dy}
\end{equation}
Therefore:
\begin{equation}
P\frac{dP}{dy} = f(y, P)
\end{equation}
This is 1st order w.r.t P and can be solved by appropriate 1st order methods.

\subsection{Finding the CF}
The general solution (GS) of a 2nd order ODE can be expressed as the sum of two other functions, called the \textbf{complementary function} (CF) and the \textbf{particular integral} (PI).
\begin{equation}
y_{GS} = y_{CF} + y_{PI}
\end{equation} 
A 2nd order ODE will usually be presented to us in the form:
\begin{equation} \label{generalformdifferential}
a\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + b\frac{dy}{dx} + c = f(x)
\end{equation}
It can be shown that the CF can be calculated from the LHS of the above equation. We write down the \textbf{auxiliary equation}, which is simply the equation:
\begin{equation}
a\lambda^{2} + b\lambda + c = 0
\end{equation}
using a, b, c from above. Solving this gives us two values, $ \lambda_{1} $ and $ \lambda_{2} $.

\subsubsection*{Case 1: $ \lambda_{1} \neq \lambda_{2} $, both real}
We can express the CF as:
\begin{equation}
y_{CF} = A_{1}e^{\lambda_{1}x} + A_{2}e^{\lambda_{2}x}
\end{equation}
where $ A_{1} $ and $ A_{2} $ are arbitrary constants.

\subsubsection*{Case 2: $ \lambda_{1} = \lambda_{2} $, both real}
Same as above, but we stick an $ x $ in front of one of the clashing parts of the solution.
\begin{equation}
y_{CF} = A_{1}e^{\lambda x} + A_{2}xe^{\lambda x}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Case 3: $ \lambda_{1} $, $ \lambda_{2} $ are complex}
If the auxiliary equation has complex roots, $ \lambda_{1} $ and $ \lambda_{2} $ will be complex conjugates. The CF can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y_{CF} & = A_{1}e^{(a + bi)x} + A_{2}e^{(a - bi)x} \\
       & = e^{a}(A_{1}e^{i(bx)} + A_{2}e^{- i(bx)}) \\
       & = e^{a}(C_{1}cos(bx) + C_{2}sin(bx))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $ C_{1} = A_{1} + A_{2} $ and $ C_{2} = (A_{1} - A_{2})i $. Note that even though $ A_{1} $ and $ A_{2} $ may have been complex, $ C_{1} $ and $ C_{2} $ are necessarily real.

\subsection{Finding the PI}
The particular integral is \emph{any function $ y_{PI} $ that satisfies the ENTIRE differential equation}. The particular integral can be calculated depending on the form of the RHS of equation \ref{generalformdifferential}. We will refer to the RHS as simply $ f(x) $ and the particular integral (as before) as $ y_{PI} $. We can follow some basic rules:


\subsubsection*{Case 1: $ f(x) $ is a polynomial}
Try setting $ y_{PI} $ as a general polynomial of the same degree. e.g. if $ f(x) $ is a quadratic, try setting $ y_{PI} = ax^{2} + bx + c $ and substituting into the ODE. We will solve for a, b, c, and this will give us $ y_{PI} $.

\subsubsection*{Case 2: $ f(x) $ is a multiple of $ e^{bx} $, $ e^{bx} $ NOT in CF}
Choose $ y_{PI} = Ae^{bx} $ for some real number A.

\subsubsection*{Case 3: $ f(x) $ is a multiple of $ e^{bx} $, $ e^{bx} $ IS in CF}
We now have a clash between the PI and the CF. We can try $ y_{PI} = Axe^{bx} $, i.e. sticking an x in the PI to avoid the clash. If this doesn't work, we can choose $ y_{PI} = A(x)e^{bx} $ for some real FUNCTION A. Remember to use the CHAIN RULE to differentiate A this time.
\\\\
At the end remove any clashing terms, i.e. terms of the form $ Be^{\lambda x} $ where $ e^{\lambda x} $ is already present in the CF. Other terms with more $ x $'s included are allowed, e.g. $ xe^{\lambda x} $ would not count as a clashing term.

\subsubsection*{Case 4: $ f(x) = A(x)e^{bx} $ where $ A(x) $ is a polynomial}
Choose $ y_{PI} = C(x)e^{bx} $ for some polynomial $ C(x) $.

\subsubsection*{Case 5: $ f(x) $ is trigonometric (e.g. sin, cos, sinh etc.)}
Look for a pattern in $ f(x) $. A good tip for an $ f(x) $ with only sines/cosines is to use $ y_{PI} = A\cos(x) + B\sin(x) $ and solve for A and B. A similar story for sinh and cosh.
CAUTION: sinh, cosh and tanh are actually exponential functions in disguise, so make sure they do not clash with any $ e^{\lambda x} $ terms in the CF.

\subsubsection*{Other cases}
If $ f(x) $ has a term of the form $ e^{x}\cos(x) $ or $ e^{x}\sin(x) $ then we can rewrite it as the real/imaginary part of a complex function (in this case $ e^{(1+i)x} $ would be appropriate, since it expands to $ e^{x}(\cos(x) + i\sin(x)) $.
\\\\
If $ f(x) $ is more complicated, we may have to be imaginative with the choice of $ y_{PI} $. e.g. for $ f(x) = Ae^{ax} + Be^{bx} $ we could choose $ y_{PI} = Ce^{ax} + De^{bx} $ for some constants $ C, D $. Again be careful of terms that clash with the CF.

\section{Solving systems of differential equations}
A homogeneous 1st order system of equations can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dx}{dt} & = F(x, y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} & = G(x, y)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Let us choose an example coupled system:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dx}{dt} & = ax + by \\
\frac{dy}{dt} & = cx + dy
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can rewrite this in matrix form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The system is now of the form
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}v = Mv
\end{equation}
If we set $ v = Ve^{\lambda  t} $, where V is a constant vector independent of $ x, y $ or $ t $, then we get
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\lambda V & = MV \\
(M - \lambda I_{n})V & = 0_{v} \\
\det(M - \lambda I_{n}) & = 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Predictably, we find two eigenvalues $ \lambda_{1} ,  \lambda_{2} $ and (any) two eigenvectors $ v_{1},  v_{2} $. The solution to the system is given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
= A_{1}v_{1}e^{\lambda_{1}t} + A_{2}v_{2}e^{\lambda_{2}t}
\end{equation}
The dimension of the eigenvectors will always match the number of variables being dealt with, for example a possible scenario is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
= A_{1}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 \\
-5
\end{pmatrix}
e^{-3t} + A_{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
7 \\
-2
\end{pmatrix}
e^{2t}
\end{equation}
The values of the individual derivatives can be found by reading off the rows of the matrices.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
x & = 3A_{1}e^{-3t} + 7A_{2}e^{2t} \\
y & = -5A_{1}e^{-3t} + -2A_{2}e^{2t}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Complex eigenvalues}
If the eigenvalues turn out to be complex conjugates, the solution can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
= A_{1}v_{1}e^{(a + bi)t} + A_{2}v_{2}e^{(a - bi)t}
\end{equation}
(Note that $ A_{1} $ and $ A_{2} $ may be complex). We can do some rearranging like before to tidy up the solution:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
& = A_{1}v_{1}e^{(a + bi)t} + A_{2}v_{2}e^{(a - bi)t} \\
& = e^{a}(A_{1}v_{1}e^{i(bt)} + A_{2}v_{2}e^{- i(bt)}) \\
& = e^{a}(C_{1}\cos(bt) + C_{2}\sin(bt))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $ C_{1} = A_{1}v_{1} + A_{2}v_{2} $ and $ C_{2} = (A_{1}v_{1} - A_{2}v_{2})i $. Note that $ C_{1} $ and $ C_{2} $ are vectors.

\subsection{Phase portraits}

\section{Difference equations}

Difference equations are very similar to differential equations, both in their construction and in their solution. Terms are given as $ U(n), U(n+1) $ etc. instead of $ \frac{dy}{dx}, \frac{d^{2} y}{dx^{2}} $. We can reapply definitions such as \textbf{auxiliary equation}, \textbf{complementary function} and \textbf{particular integral}, and once again the general solution is defined by:
\begin{equation} \label{generalformdifference}
U(n)_{GS} = U(n)_{CF} + U(n)_{PI}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Finding the CF}

For a general recurrence relation:
\begin{equation}
aU(n+2) + bU(n+1) + cU(n) = f(n)
\end{equation}
we can set up the auxiliary equation:
\begin{equation}
a \lambda^{2} + b \lambda + c = 0
\end{equation}
where the solutions to the quadratic are given by $ \lambda_{1} $ and $ \lambda_{2} $.

\subsubsection*{Case 1: $ \lambda_{1} \neq \lambda_{2} $}

\begin{equation}
U(n)_{CF} = A_{1} (\lambda_{1})^{n} + A_{2} (\lambda_{2})^{n}
\end{equation}
for arbitrary constants $ A_{1}, A_{2} $.

\subsubsection*{Case 2: $ \lambda_{1} = \lambda_{2} $}

We stick an $ n $ in front of one of the clashing terms:
\begin{equation}
U(n)_{CF} = A_{1} (\lambda)^{n} + A_{2} n(\lambda)^{n}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Finding the PI}

We refer to the RHS of equation \ref{generalformdifference} as $ f(n) $.

\subsubsection*{Case 1: $ f(n) = Cp^{n} $ where $ p \neq \lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, (C $ constant)}

Try a solution of the form $ U(n)_{PI} = Ap^{n} $ for some constant $ A $.

\subsubsection*{Case 2: $ f(n) = Cp^{n} $ where $ p = \lambda_{1} $ or $ p = \lambda_{2}, (C $ constant)}

Try a solution of the form $ U(n)_{PI} = A(n)p^{n} $ where $ A(n) $ is a polynomial with the same degree as the order of the recurrence relation. Remember to remove any clashing terms at the end.

\subsubsection*{Case 3: $ f(n) $ is a polynomial of degree $ n $}

Choose $ U(n)_{PI} $ as a suitable polynomial of degree $ n $.

\subsubsection*{Case 4: $ f(n) $ is (polynomial in $ n )p^{n}$}

Choose $ U(n)_{PI} $ as (polynomial of degree $ n)p^{n} $.

\subsection*{$ \Delta $ (forward difference operator)}

The $ \Delta $ operator is defined as:
\begin{align}
\Delta U(n) & = U(n+1) - U(n) \\
\Delta^{2} U(n) & = (U(n+2) - U(n+1)) - (U(n+1) - U(n)) \\
& \vdots \\ 
& \textrm{etc.}
\end{align}
Note that:
\begin{align}
\Delta n^{k} & = (n+1)^{k} - n^{k} \\
\Delta (\textrm{polynomial of degree k}) & = \textrm{polynomial of degree } k - 1
\end{align}

\subsection{Difference tables}

We can construct difference tables, where every entry in a row corresponds to the difference between two terms in the row above:
\\\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{differencetable}
\\\\
We say the above sequence $ R(n) $ is quartic, since the $ \Delta^{4}R(n) $ terms are constant.
\\
To calculate the next number in the sequence $ R(n) $, we can add another $ 0 $ to the $ \Delta^{5} $ row and follow the pattern upwards.

\section{Fixed point iteration}

Fixed-point iteration is a method of finding an approximate solution to $ f(x) = 0 $ for some function $ f $. We rewrite $ f(x) = 0 $ as an iterative formula:
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1} = F(x_{n})
\end{equation}
for some function $ F $. Let $ a $ denote the value that $ x_{n} $ tends towards. The associated \textbf{fixed point} of this formula is the point $ (a, 0) $. The fixed point is also the point of intersection between the lines $ y = x $ and $ y = F(x) $.
\\\\
We let the error term $ \epsilon_{n} $ be defined as:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{n} = a - x_{n}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Case 1: $ F'(a) \neq 0 $}

In this case we say the formula has linear convergence. The error in each iterate changes by a factor of $ F'(a) $:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{n+1} \approx \epsilon_{n} F'(a)
\end{equation}
Upon further expansion we get:
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{n+1} & \approx \epsilon_{n} F'(a) \\
& \approx \epsilon_{n-1} F'(a)^{2} \\
& \vdots \\
& \approx \epsilon_{0} F'(a)^{n+1}
\end{align}
It is easy to see that if $ |F'(a)| < 1 $, the error terms will get tend to $ 0 $ and the iterative formula will indeed converge to $ a $. If $ |F'(a)| > 1 $, the error terms get bigger and the formula diverges from $ a $.

\subsubsection*{Case 2: $ F'(a) = 0, F''(a) \neq 0 $}

In this case the formula has quadratic convergence.
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{n+1} \approx \frac{\epsilon_{n}^{2}}{2} F''(a)
\end{equation}
In this case we can see that for convergence, we must have $ |F''(a)| < 1 $.

\subsection{Newton-Raphson method}

The Newton-Raphson method is a special case of fixed-point iteration. The Newton-Raphson iterative formula to find a solution to $ f(x) = 0 $ is given by:
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1} =x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}
\end{equation}
Newton-Raphson always converges quadratically, however it will only converge in specific situations (e.g. when there are no stationary points in between $ x_{0} $ and $ a $).

\section{Partial differentation and vector calculus}

\subsection{Exact equations}
Let us say we have an ODE of the form:
\begin{equation}
P(x, y) + Q(x, y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0
\end{equation}
(note the coefficients are multi-variable functions). This can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation} \label{exactdifferential}
P(x, y) dx + Q(x, y) dy = 0
\end{equation}
We can try the exact equations method. We say an equation is exact iff:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \equiv \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} 
\end{equation}
This simple condition implies some important results. It can be shown that an exact equation implies the LHS of equation \ref{exactdifferential} is an exact (total) differential). This means it can be written as $ df $, where f is some function of $ x $ and $ y $. But the equation of this total differential is:
\begin{equation}
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy
\end{equation}
Comparing to equation \ref{exactdifferential} we can note 3 things:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P(x, y) & = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\
Q(x, y) & = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\
df & = 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We integrate $ P(x, y) $ w.r.t $ x $ and $ Q(x, y) $ w.r.t $ y $ and 'merge' the two expressions together (i.e. for any matching terms, write them down only once) to give us an expression for $ f(x, y) $. Ignore constants of integration. $ df = 0 $ tells us that $ f(x, y) = c $ by integration. Therefore the general solution is given by:
\begin{equation}
f(x, y) = c
\end{equation}
for some arbitrary constant c.

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{1} \vec{v}_{1} + \lambda_{2} \vec{v}_{2} + ... + \lambda_{n} \vec{v}_{n}
\end{equation}
where $ \lambda_{1}...\lambda_{n} \in \R $.

\paragraph{Span}

\paragraph{Dot product}
The dot product of $ \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}
v_{1} \\ \vdots \\ v_{n}
\end{pmatrix} $ and $ \vec{u} = \begin{pmatrix}
u_{1} \\ \vdots \\ u_{n}
\end{pmatrix} $ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} = v_{1} u_{1} + v_{2} u_{2} + ... + v_{n} u_{n}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Norm}
The norm (aka length) of a vector $ \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}
v_{1} \\ \vdots \\ v_{n}
\end{pmatrix} $ in $ \R^{n} $ is defined by:
\begin{equation}
||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i}^{2}}

\paragraph{Zero matrix}
An $ m \times n $ matrix with all entries 0. Denoted by $ \vec{0}_{m \times n} $.

\paragraph{Transpose}
The transpose of a matrix $ \vec{A} $ is the result of flipping all rows with columns and vice versa. Denoted by $ \vec{A}^{T} $.

\paragraph{$ (a_{ij}) $ notation}
For an $ m \times n $ matrix $ \vec{A} $, we can say $ \vec{A} = (a_{ij}) $ if we represent the matrix as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1j} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2j} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots &        & \vdots \\
a_{i1} & a_{i2} & \cdots & a_{ij} & \cdots & a_{in} \\
\vdots & \vdots &        & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mj} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\\
$ i $ denotes the row number and $ j $ denotes the column number. Hence we have $ 1 \leq i \leq m $ and $ 1 \leq j \leq n $.

\paragraph{Leading diagonal}
Let $ \vec{A} = (a_{ij}) $. The leading diagonal is made up of all entries of the form $ a_{ii} $, e.g. $ a_{11}, a_{22}, $ etc.

\paragraph{Identity matrix}

\paragraph{Linear equation}
A linear equation of variables $ x_{1}...x_{n} \in \R $ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{1} x_{1} + \lambda_{2} x_{2} + ... + \lambda_{n} x_{n} = b
\end{equation}
where $ \lambda_{1} ... \lambda_{n}, b \in R $.

\paragraph{System of linear equations}
A system of linear equations is a set of simultaneous linear equations.

\paragraph{Free variable}
A variable in a system of linear equations that can be set to any value, without affecting the validity of the solution.

\paragraph{Basic variable}
Any variable that is not a free variable (i.e. a solution only exists for particular values of this variable).

\paragraph{Augmented matrix}
For a system of linear equations represented as $ \vec{A} \vec{x} = \vec{b} $, the augmented matrix is $ (\vec{A} \ | \ \vec{b}) $. This is the matrix $ \vec{A} $ but with $ \vec{b} $ added in as an extra column on the right.

\paragraph{Row operation}
There are 3 types of row operation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Swapping rows
\item Multiplying a row by a scalar value
\item Adding a multiple of one row to another
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Leading entry}
The leading entry of a row is the first non-zero entry in that row.

\paragraph{Row echelon form}
A matrix is in row echelon form if:
\begin{itemize}
\item All non-zero rows are above rows of all zeroes
\item Each leading entry is $ 1 $, and is in a column to the right of the leading entry in the row above
\item All entries in the column below a leading entry are $ 0 $
\end{itemize}
Note that any matrix in row echelon form is upper triangular.

\paragraph{Reduced row echelon form (RREF)}
A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if:
\begin{itemize}
\item The matrix is in reduced echelon form
\item Each leading entry is the only non-zero entry in its column
\end{itemize}
Any matrix in RREF is upper AND lower triangular.

\paragraph{Upper triangular}
A matrix is upper triangular if $ a_{ij} = 0 $ for $ i > j $.
\\
i.e. only the top-right half contains non-zero entries.

\paragraph{Strictly upper triangular}
A matrix is strictly upper triangular if $ a_{ij} = 0 $ for $ i \geq j $.

\paragraph{Lower triangular}
A matrix is lower triangular if $ a_{ij} = 0 $ for $ i < j $.
\\
i.e. only the bottom-left half contains non-zero entries.

\paragraph{Strictly lower triangular}
A matrix is strictly lower triangular if $ a_{ij} = 0 $ for $ i \leq j $.

\paragraph{Diagonal matrix}
A diagonal matrix is such that $ a_{ij} = 0 $ if $ i \neq j $.
\\
i.e. Only the leading diagonal contains non-zero entries.

\paragraph{Inverse}
The inverse of an $ n \times n $ matrix $ \vec{A} $ is such that:
\begin{equation}
\vec{A}^{-1} \vec{A} = \vec{A} \vec{A}^{-1} = I_{n}
\end{equation}
Note that this is one of the only occasions where matrix multiplication is commutative. Not all matrices have inverses.

\paragraph{Singular}
A matrix is called singular if it is non-invertible.

\paragraph{Determinant}
A specific number calculated from the entries in a matrix. Used in computing inverses. Denoted by $ \det(A) $.

\paragraph{Elementary matrix}
A matrix that differs from the identity matrix by one row operation.

\paragraph{Eigenvalue}
An eigenvalue of a matrix $ \vec{A} $ is some $ \lambda \in R $ that satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\vec{A} \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
\end{equation}
for some $ \vec{v} \in \R^{n} $, called the eigenvector.

\paragraph{Eigenvalue}
An eigenvector of a matrix $ \vec{A} $ is some $ \vec{v} \in R^{n} $ that satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\vec{A} \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}
\end{equation}
for some $ \lambda \in \R $, called the eigenvalue.
